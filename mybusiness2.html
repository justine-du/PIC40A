            Hello! My name is Justine Du, proud owner of a newly established decorating
            food company called Justine's&reg; Estehetic Eatery. I am currently attending UCLA as a
            Cognitive Science major with a Specialization in Computing, and my favorite thing in
            the world is food and aesthetic-looking stuff. Combining the two, my goal is to bring that
            same visual and emotional happiness to you!</p>
            <br/>

         It seems like there has always been a separation between aesthetics and food: food was just
         meant to be eaten and pretty pictures and things were just meant to be looked at. However, I
         had a new idea of making beautifully decorated things edible as well to enhance the enjoyment
         of people all over the world. To be able to customize your own colors and textures and make
         food your own creation was revolutionary.</p>
         <br/>
         <p> I want to bring that same enjoyment to you and your family, to create and customize your work of art into something that can not only be admired
         but also bring joy to your hungry stomachs as well! Our company is set on creating your
         perfect cake, hamburger, pizza, or whatever you can think of to your doorstep, so come and
         order today!</p>
